# Contributing to SpikingGraph

This project is governed by a single principle: only the objectively fastest and most efficient code will be integrated into the codebase. All contributions are welcome, regardless of background or affiliation. There are no hierarchies or gatekeepersâ€”contribution is purely egalitarian.

## Guidelines
- Submit code that is demonstrably faster or more efficient than existing implementations.
- Provide benchmarks or evidence of performance improvements when possible.
- All code must be compatible with the project's supported platforms and hardware (CPU, GPU, NPU).
- Pull requests should be clear, focused, and include relevant tests or usage examples.
- Discussions and reviews are open to all. The best code, as measured by objective performance, will be merged.

## Process
1. Fork the repository and create your feature branch.
2. Make your changes with a focus on speed and efficiency.
3. Submit a pull request with benchmarks or evidence of improvement.
4. Engage in open discussion and review.
5. The objectively best solution will be merged.

There are no other requirements. The only standard is performance and efficiency.
