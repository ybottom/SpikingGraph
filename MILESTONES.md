# Project Milestones and Deliverables

## 1. Core SNN Engine
- Real-time inference/training loop
- Optimized compute kernels for CPU, GPU, NPU
- Event-driven simulation and sparse updates
- Surrogate gradient descent training

## 2. Hardware Backends
- GPU: CUDA/OpenCL kernels, batching, streaming
- CPU: SIMD vectorization, thread pool, memory layouts
- NPU: API hooks, fallback path

## 3. Language Bindings
- C/C++ core DLL with versioned API
- FFI bindings for Python, Rust, C#, Java
- In-memory data structures and buffer sharing
- Thread safety and callback hooks

## 4. Interoperability Layer
- Direct API for buffer sharing, callbacks, FFI
- Developer hooks for integration

## 5. Documentation
- Linking, memory management, calling conventions
- Multi-language usage instructions

## 6. Project Management
- Issue templates, labels, contribution guidelines
- Project board for tracking
